# Enterprise Network Design and Implementation

## Description
Designed and implemented a scalable enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on efficient IP allocation, connectivity, and routing.

## Key Features
- **Subnetting & IP Addressing:** Applied VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) to allocate IP addresses efficiently across multiple subnets.
- **Routing:** Configured **default routes, static routes**, and **dynamic routing protocols** including **OSPF and EIGRP** for network connectivity.
- **VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing:** Segmented the network for security and performance improvements.
- **WAN Connectivity:** Established WAN links with **PPP and CHAP authentication** for secure remote communication.
- **Network Verification:** Used **ping, traceroute, and routing table analysis** to ensure full connectivity.
